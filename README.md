# Financial Sentiment Analysis

This project is a personal experiment focused on analyzing sentiment in financial data using deep learning techniques.

## Project Status

**In Progress**  
> Please note that this is an ongoing experimental project. Some results, such as accuracy, may currently be low due to the early-stage nature of the work and the need for > > further optimization and tuning.

## Notebook

The core work is contained in the Jupyter Notebook `dl5.ipynb`. It includes:

- Data downloading
- Preprocessing
- Model training
- Evaluation

## Disclaimer

> This is **not** a production-ready project. It is being used for **learning and experimentation** purposes.

## Goals

- Explore deep learning for NLP sentiment classification.
- Experiment with various architectures and preprocessing methods.
- Learn from trial and error.

## Notes

- The dataset and model performance may be improved in future iterations.
- Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
